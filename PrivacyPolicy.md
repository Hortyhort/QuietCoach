# Privacy Policy

**Quiet Coach**
*Last updated: January 2024*

---

## Our Commitment

Quiet Coach was built with privacy as a core principle. We believe your practice sessions are deeply personal, and we've designed the app to keep them that way.

**The short version:** We don't collect your data. Your audio stays on your device. We can't see your rehearsals because we never receive them.

---

## Data We Collect

### We collect nothing.

Quiet Coach does not collect, transmit, or store any personal information on external servers. Specifically:

- **No account required** — You never provide an email, name, or any personal details
- **No analytics** — We don't track how you use the app
- **No crash reporting** — We don't collect diagnostic data
- **No advertising** — No ads, no ad tracking, no advertising identifiers
- **No third-party SDKs** — No external code that could collect data

---

## Your Audio Recordings

### Stored locally, processed locally

When you record a rehearsal:

1. **Audio is saved to your device only** — Files are stored in the app's private sandbox
2. **Analysis happens on-device** — All processing (scoring, feedback generation) occurs locally using your device's processor
3. **Nothing is uploaded** — Your audio never leaves your iPhone or iPad
4. **You control deletion** — Delete individual sessions or all data at any time from Settings

We literally cannot hear your rehearsals because they never reach us.
