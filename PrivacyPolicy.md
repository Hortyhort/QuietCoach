# Privacy Policy

**Quiet Coach**
*Last updated: January 2026*

---

## Our Commitment

Quiet Coach was built with privacy as a core principle. We believe your practice sessions are deeply personal, and we've designed the app to keep them that way.

**The short version:** Your audio stays on your device. Optional iCloud sync and anonymous analytics are off by default.

---

## Data We Collect

### By default, we collect nothing off-device.

Quiet Coach runs on-device. If you opt in to iCloud sync or diagnostics, we sync session metadata and collect anonymous usage/crash/performance data to improve the app.

- **No account required** — You never provide an email, name, or any personal details
- **Optional iCloud sync** — Off by default; syncs session metadata across your devices
- **Optional analytics** — Off by default; you can opt in or out in Settings
- **Optional crash/performance reporting** — Off by default
- **No advertising** — No ads, no ad tracking, no advertising identifiers
- **Third-party analytics (optional)** — TelemetryDeck is used only if you opt in

## Your Audio Recordings

### Stored locally, processed locally

When you record a rehearsal:

1. **Audio is saved to your device only** — Files are stored in the app's private sandbox
2. **Analysis happens on-device** — All processing (scoring, feedback generation) occurs locally using your device's processor
3. **Audio stays on-device** — Recordings are not uploaded or synced via iCloud
4. **You control deletion** — Delete individual sessions or all data at any time from Settings

We cannot hear your rehearsals because recordings never reach us.

### Optional On-Device Transcription

Quiet Coach offers an optional transcription feature:

- **Opt-in, default off** — You must enable transcription in Settings
- **On-device only** — Transcription runs locally using Apple's on-device speech recognition
- **Audio-only fallback** — When transcription is off, feedback uses audio-only metrics and no transcript is stored
