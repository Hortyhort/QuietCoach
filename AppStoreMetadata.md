Practice the hard conversations.

Before the performance review. Before the breakup. Before you ask for what you deserve.

Quiet Coach gives you a private space to rehearse—and instant, calm feedback to help you improve.

HOW IT WORKS

• Pick a scenario (setting a boundary, asking for a raise, giving tough feedback)
• Tap to record your rehearsal
• Get delivery feedback: clarity, pacing, tone, confidence
• Read one actionable coaching note
• Try again—immediately

YOUR PRIVACY, PROTECTED

• All audio processed on-device
• Nothing uploaded, ever
• No account required
• Delete your data anytime

WHAT YOU'LL PRACTICE

• Setting boundaries
• Asking for a raise

SCORING SYSTEM

Quiet Coach analyzes your audio for delivery patterns—not your words:

Clarity — How well you use pauses and avoid rambling
Pacing — Your rhythm and pace of speech
Tone — Volume stability and emotional control
Confidence — Overall presence and assurance
