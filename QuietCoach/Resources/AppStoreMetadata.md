### Full Description

**Practice the words before they count.**

Everyone has conversations they dread—asking for a raise, setting a boundary, having a difficult discussion. Quiet Coach helps you rehearse these moments privately, building confidence through practice.

**How It Works:**
1. Choose a scenario that matches your situation
2. Record yourself saying what you need to say
3. Get instant feedback on how you sound
4. Practice again until you feel ready

**Real Feedback, Real Improvement:**
- **Clarity** — Are you speaking clearly and intentionally?
- **Pacing** — Is your rhythm natural and engaging?
- **Tone** — Do you sound calm and controlled?
- **Confidence** — Does your delivery project assurance?

**Privacy First:**
