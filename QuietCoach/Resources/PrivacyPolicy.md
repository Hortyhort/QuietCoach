# Quiet Coach Privacy Policy

**Last Updated:** January 2025

## Overview

Quiet Coach is designed with privacy as a core principle. We believe your practice sessions are personal, and we've built the app to keep them that way.

## Data Collection

### Audio Recordings

- **What we collect:** Audio recordings you create during practice sessions
- **How it's used:** Analyzed on your device to provide feedback on clarity, pacing, tone, and confidence
- **Where it's stored:** Only on your device, in the app's private storage
- **Sharing:** Never uploaded, transmitted, or shared with anyone
- **Retention:** Deleted when you delete a session or uninstall the app

### Speech Recognition

- **Technology:** Apple's on-device Speech framework
- **Opt-in, default off:** You must enable transcription in Settings
- **Processing:** All transcription happens locally on your device
- **Fallback:** When transcription is off, coaching uses audio-only metrics and no transcript is stored
- **Data sent to Apple:** None — we use on-device recognition only

### Analytics (Optional)

If you opt in to analytics in Settings:

- **What we collect:** Anonymous usage patterns (e.g., which scenarios are popular, session completion rates)
- **What we don't collect:** Audio content, transcriptions, personal identifiers
- **Purpose:** Improve app features and user experience
- **You can opt out:** Settings > Privacy > Analytics

### Crash Reporting (Optional)

If you opt in to crash reporting:

- **What we collect:** Technical information about app crashes
- **What we don't collect:** Audio, personal data, or session content
- **Purpose:** Fix bugs and improve stability
- **You can opt out:** Settings > Privacy > Crash Reporting

## Data We Never Collect
