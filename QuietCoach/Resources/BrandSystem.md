# Quiet Coach: Liquid Glass Brand System

---

## Phase 1: Brand Understanding

### The Problem
People avoid important conversations because they don't know what to say—or fear saying it wrong. The words exist somewhere inside, but anxiety buries them. Most practice happens in the shower, in the car, at 2am. Fragmented. Unwitnessed. Unimproved.

### The Emotional Shift
**Before:** Chest tight. Words tangled. Avoiding the person. Rehearsing arguments alone.
**After:** Clarity. The words feel findable. The conversation feels possible.

### The Ritual
Open the app. Choose the conversation weighing on you. Speak into the quiet. Hear yourself. Receive gentle insight. Close the app knowing you can do this.

### Emotional Register
**Calming + Clarifying**

Not empowering in a loud way. Not grounding in a heavy way. The app should feel like taking a breath before speaking. Like the moment your thoughts finally arrange themselves. Glass is the perfect metaphor: clarity through stillness.

## Phase 2: Brand System

### 1. Brand Essence

**Philosophy:**
*Find your words before you need them.*

**Core Values:**
1. **Privacy is presence** — Your voice stays yours. The app listens, never records to the cloud.
2. **Practice is kindness** — Rehearsing isn't weakness; it's care for yourself and the other person.
3. **Clarity emerges** — The right words aren't invented; they're uncovered.

**Emotional North Star:**
The exhale before speaking.

### 2. Name & Language

**Name:** Quiet Coach

The name is correct. "Quiet" signals privacy, calm, and the inner voice. "Coach" implies guidance without judgment. Together: a calm presence that helps you find your way. No refinement needed.

**Tagline:**
*Practice the words before they count.*

**Voice & Tone Rules:**

| Context | Tone | Example |
|---------|------|---------|
| Buttons | Gentle imperative | "Begin rehearsal" not "Start now!" |
| Empty states | Observational, not lonely | "No sessions yet. When you're ready." |
| Errors | Matter-of-fact, solution-first | "Recording interrupted. Tap to try again." |
| Success | Quiet affirmation | "Saved." / "You did it." |
| Coaching notes | Second-person, observational | "Your pacing steadied in the second half." |

**Words to use:** practice, rehearse, find, ready, yours, quiet, clear
**Words to avoid:** crush it, nail it, master, dominate, unlock, level up

### 3. Liquid Glass Visual Language

**Material Specification:**

#### Glass Opacity Tiers
| Tier | Opacity | Blur | Use Case |
|------|---------|------|----------|
| **Ambient** | 4–8% | 80pt | Full-screen backgrounds, atmosphere |
| **Surface** | 12–18% | 40pt | Cards, sheets, primary containers |
| **Interactive** | 20–30% | 20pt | Buttons, segmented controls, active states |
| **Focal** | 40–60% | 8pt | Recording indicator, score cards, emphasis |

#### Edge & Corner Logic
- **Large containers:** 24–32pt radius (sheets, cards)
- **Medium elements:** 14–18pt radius (buttons, inputs)
- **Small elements:** 8–12pt radius (chips, badges)
- **Edge treatment:** 0.5pt inner stroke at 8% white, never a hard border

#### Refraction & Highlight Behavior
- Top-left highlight: 4% white, feathered 40pt
- Bottom-right shadow: 2% black, offset 2pt
- On interaction: highlight brightens to 8%, shifts 2pt toward touch point
- Motion: glass elements should feel like they have *weight*—no instant transitions

#### Color Palette

**Base Colors:**
- `qcBackground`: Pure black (#000000) — the void behind glass
- `qcSurface`: Near-black (#0A0A0C) — elevated surfaces
- `qcTextPrimary`: Off-white (#F5F5F7) — primary text
- `qcTextSecondary`: Warm gray (#8E8E93) — supporting text

**Glass Tints:**
- `qcGlassClear`: White at 6% — neutral glass
- `qcGlassWarm`: Amber at 4% — coaching moments, warmth
- `qcGlassCool`: Blue at 4% — recording, analysis, focus

**Accent Colors:**
- `qcAccent`: Soft violet (#9D8CFF) — primary actions, AI moments
- `qcSuccess`: Muted teal (#6AC4A8) — completion, positive feedback
- `qcWarning`: Warm amber (#E8A855) — areas for improvement
- `qcActive`: Soft coral (#E87D6C) — recording state

#### Typography

**Typeface:** SF Pro (system)
- Display: SF Pro Rounded, Medium — warmth without whimsy
- Body: SF Pro Text, Regular
- Captions: SF Pro Text, Medium — legibility on glass

**Weights for Glass:**
- Avoid Light weights on translucent backgrounds (legibility fails)
- Prefer Medium for body, Semibold for emphasis
- Never use Bold on glass—it feels heavy

**Optical Adjustments:**
- Text on glass: +2% opacity boost on the text layer
- Letter spacing on glass: +0.5pt tracking for readability

## Phase 3: Logo & Icon Design

### 4. Logo System

#### Concept A: "The Breath"
**Symbol:** Two soft, overlapping rounded forms suggesting an inhale/exhale rhythm—or a speech bubble dissolving into calm.

**Geometry:** Organic, asymmetric, feels hand-drawn but mathematically precise. Think: two pebbles resting beside each other.

**Emotional meaning:** The moment between thinking and speaking. Breath as preparation.

**On glass:** The forms are stroked, not filled—so glass shows through. At rest, 60% opacity. On hover/focus, fills softly to 80%.

**Usage:** Symbol-only for app icon and small marks. Combined with "Quiet Coach" wordmark for marketing and splash.

**When it appears:** App icon, splash (subtle, not animated), settings header, share cards.

---

#### Concept B: "The Clearing"
**Symbol:** A single rounded rectangle with a soft circular void in the center—suggesting a window, a clearing in fog, or a space to speak into.

**Geometry:** Precise, architectural. The void is not centered; it sits slightly high and left, creating visual breath.

**Emotional meaning:** Making space for your voice. Clarity emerging.

**On glass:** The outer form is glass. The inner void reveals the background—making it feel like a portal, not a graphic.

**Usage:** Works as symbol-only. The void is the icon.

**When it appears:** App icon, onboarding illustrations, empty states.

---

#### Concept C: "The Echo"
**Symbol:** Three concentric rounded forms, progressively fading—like a voice rippling outward, or sound waves stilling into silence.

**Geometry:** Soft, radial. Each ring 60% the opacity of the one before it. The innermost is solid.

**Emotional meaning:** Your voice, heard and then released. Practice that fades into confidence.

**On glass:** The rings are the glass. Each tier uses a different opacity level, demonstrating the material system in the logo itself.

**Usage:** Symbol + wordmark together. The rings are too abstract alone at small sizes.

**When it appears:** Marketing materials, loading states (animated as a subtle pulse), about screen.

---

**Recommended Direction:** Concept A ("The Breath") for primary mark. Concept B ("The Clearing") for app icon alternate if dimensional clarity is preferred.

---

### 5. App Icon Direction

#### Primary Icon Concept: "Glass Breath"

**Visual Description:**
A dark field (not black—very dark violet-gray, #12101A). Two soft, overlapping ovoid forms in Liquid Glass—one slightly larger, one smaller, offset like a Venn diagram that doesn't quite touch. The forms are not flat; they have:
- A soft top-left highlight (white at 15%)
- A subtle inner gradient (violet tint, 8%)
- A 1pt inner stroke (white at 10%)
- Soft drop shadow beneath (black at 20%, 4pt blur, offset 2pt down)

The forms feel like glass beads resting on velvet. They glow faintly.

**At Small Sizes (29pt, Spotlight):**
The two forms should read as a single calming mark—not detailed, just *present*. The highlights simplify to a single bright point.

**Dark Mode vs Light Mode:**
- Dark mode: Violet-black background, glass forms brighter
- Light mode: Soft warm gray background (#F0EDE8), glass forms pick up subtle amber tint

#### Secondary / Fallback Concept: "The Clearing"
A single rounded-square frame with a soft void in the center. The frame is glass. The void shows the background. At small sizes, it reads as a portal or window. Less distinctive than Concept A, but more versatile.

**Material Behavior:**
The icon must feel *dimensional*. If it could exist on a desk, it would be:
- A paperweight
- A frosted glass bead
- A worry stone

Not a sticker. Not a badge. An object.

---

### 6. In-App Iconography

**Line Weight:**
- 1.5pt stroke for primary icons (24pt size)
- 2pt stroke for large icons (32pt+)
- 1pt stroke for compact contexts (caption icons)

**Corner Radius:**
- Stroke corners: 2pt radius (rounded, not sharp, not circular)
- Maintains consistency with Liquid Glass corner logic

**Stroke vs Filled:**
- **Default:** Stroke only (icons live *within* glass; fills compete)
- **Active/Selected:** Subtle fill at 20% opacity behind stroke
- **Emphasis:** Full fill only for recording state or destructive actions

**Positioning on Glass:**
- Icons sit *inside* glass containers, not on top
- 8–12pt padding from glass edge minimum
- Never place icon at the exact center of a large glass surface (feels clinical)

**When Icons Disappear:**
- During recording: all UI retreats, only waveform and stop button remain
- In review: scores are shapes/numbers, not icons
- Empty states: use words, not illustrated icons

## Phase 4: Brand in Practice

### 7. Examples

**App Store Description — Opening Paragraph:**
> Some conversations stay on your mind for days. The raise. The boundary. The apology. Quiet Coach gives you space to practice before they happen. Record yourself. Hear your words. Get gentle feedback. Then walk in ready.

**Onboarding Headline:**
> *Everyone has conversations they dread.*
> *What if you could practice them first?*

**Empty State (No Sessions):**
> No sessions yet.
> When you're ready, pick a scenario.

**Success State (After Recording):**
> Saved.
> You said what you needed to say.

---

### 8. Do Not Do (Critical)

**Visual Anti-Patterns:**
- ❌ Flat, filled icons on glass (they punch holes in the material)
- ❌ White-on-white text, even with shadows (illegible)
- ❌ Colored glass without purpose (glass should be tinted *for meaning*, not decoration)
- ❌ Hard borders on any element (everything has soft edges)
- ❌ Stock illustration style (no "tech bro in hoodie looking at phone")

**Motion Mistakes:**
- ❌ Bouncy spring animations (too playful; this app is calm)
- ❌ Instant transitions (glass has weight; honor it)
- ❌ Parallax on glass layers (feels gimmicky, not material)
- ❌ Pulsing anything except the active recording state

**Logo Misuse:**
- ❌ Placing logo on a busy background without glass backing
- ❌ Animating the logo on every launch (once per session, maximum)
- ❌ Scaling below 24pt without switching to simplified mark
- ❌ Adding glow/shadow effects beyond the defined material spec

**Glass Overuse:**
- ❌ Stacking more than 2 glass layers (clarity requires restraint)
- ❌ Glass on glass on glass (creates visual mud)
- ❌ Using glass for every element (hierarchy disappears)
- ❌ Blurring text for effect (blur is for depth, not decoration)

## Summary

Quiet Coach is not loud. It is not empowering in the way fitness apps are. It exists in the moment before—the breath, the pause, the preparation.

Liquid Glass is not just a style. It is the metaphor: clarity through calm. Light passing through stillness. Your voice, visible to yourself.

The brand should feel like it has always existed and was simply waiting for the technology to express it. Calm. Clear. Inevitable.

*This brand system was designed for iOS 26 and beyond, where Liquid Glass is the native language of Apple platforms.*
